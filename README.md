### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by!

Iâ€™m currently working on lots of exciting stuff for [Truepill](https://www.truepill.com/).

I'm currently working with React, JavaScript, TypeScript daily, and have spent the last year getting my head around Go ðŸŒ±

I'm always looking for something exciting to work on, and am currently on the market for an open source project to get involved in where I can ðŸ‘¯

âš¡ Fun fact: If I'm not coding, you'll find my singing for [The Mini Big Band](http://www.theminibigband.co.uk/) :microphone:
